# JournalApp

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple journal application built with C#. As a software engineer, this exercise is designed to enhance my understanding of building console applications using C#. It provides a foundation for developing more complex applications with file I/O and data management.

The software includes functionality for creating, reading, saving, and loading journal entries. This program helps beginners understand how to build and interact with console applications and manage data persistence.

## Purpose
The purpose of creating this software is to practice using C# for basic console application functionality. It also provides a starting point for understanding file I/O operations and managing data within a C# application.
